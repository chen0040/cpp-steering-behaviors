<!--
in "create" element, the model attribute specified the 3D model file used for the agent,  the locomotion_type specified that the agent is a robot based on land travelling, the locomotion_type current support three value LANDCRAFT_ROBOT, STATIC_OBJ and AIRCRAFT, hovering_height is a  distance of the agent to the ground, this value can be set non-zero to simulate a hovering land robot
in "move" element, the position of the agent is removed as this information is not needed by the server
in "destroy" element, when body_state_period is set to -1, the corpsed will not be removed by the server, otherwise it will stay a number of seconds specified by the value of the attribute
-->

<!--
in the speak element
gender can be either "MALE" or "FEMALE" [required]
voice_pitch is 1-6 for "MALE" and 1-4 for "FEMALE"  [default is 1]  [optional]
pitch is 0-99 [default is 50] [optional]
amplitude is 0-200 [default is 100] [optional]
